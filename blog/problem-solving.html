    <h2>Problem solving stories and techniques..</h2>
    <h3>Was blocked on a simple problem..</h3>

    <h3>Elegantly solved a problem..</h3>

    <h3>Rating my confidence with these different problem solving techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Psuedocode: </strong>5/10 – I think my Psuedocode will get better over time. I think at the moment I struggle a little bit with it as I don’t really have a solid idea most of the time how I will actually attempt to solve a challenge</li>
      <li><strong>Trying Something: </strong>9/10 – This is my first go to. Just trying something that seems logical at first thought and seeing what happens</li>
      <li><strong>Rubby Ducky Method: </strong>6/10 – Not one I have used so much yet I realise when I can explain something to someone then I know the problem should be easier to solve</li>
      <li><strong>Reading Error Messages: </strong>7/10 – Really helpful with syntax errors. Still get a little confused with some messages but I’m getting better</li>
      <li><strong>Console.logging: </strong>9/10 – Up there with ‘trying something’. I find it a great way to realise where I’m failing and what part of the code I need to work on</li>
      <li><strong>Googling: </strong>8/10 – Can be a little hit and miss sometimes but I find I can usually find something useful</li>
      <li><strong>Asking Peers For Help: </strong>7/10 – This is one of the last steps I would take. I’ve done it a couple of times now and have found to get useful answers</li>
      <li><strong>Asking Coaches For Help: </strong>5/10 – Would be the last option I guess. Slightly less confident as it means in a way I still l haven’t figured it out from all the above options haha</li>
      <li><strong>Improving Your Process With Reflection: </strong>7/10 – I’m confident in the sense that I try and note down different solutions I can then look back at later on.</li>
