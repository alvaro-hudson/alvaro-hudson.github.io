      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
      <p>Knowing that your brain is something that can be moulded rather than being fixed can have a number of benefits. It firstly broadens your horizons, as what you thought would be beyond your capability is now potentially a possibility. It can help you step back and have a broader perspective. It can be like being stuck in the middle of a maze. What you think from the ground may be that it's impossible to get out of, so perhaps why even try. If you instead are able remember that there is in fact a way out, that you just need to keep trying new routes, you will better remember the routes you have been on and be able to extend further and further out in the maze, until you find the exit you were looking for. This can help people in changing their mindsets, taking on new challenges, helping with recoveries, amongst other benefits.</p>

      <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
      <p>At the moment, the concept of neuroplasticity will be very helpful whilst doing this Devacademy course. It will remind me that my brain does have the capability to learn these concepts and that it’s just a matter of practice and perseverance. I’ll also need to remind myself to extend it to my everyday life and try not to view something as impossible for me, that it’s just a challenge.</p>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>There are different challenges you can give yourself to try and increase your neuroplasticity. Learning a new language, making art or music, learning some other new skill; doing something in a way is new for your brain and that will help it create new connections. As well, exercise and sleeping well are helpful so that your body and brain are in a good starting position to head off down a new path.</p>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
      <p>Growth mindset is changing your approach from a binary or fixed system of success/failure, to one of realising that you are on a path of learning. It’s realising that success isn’t necessarily being able to demonstrate that you have successfully completed the immediate challenge in front of you, success is what you have learnt from that task and knowing that it is a step forward in growing your knowledge and potential. It means that if you come across a challenge that seems too hard, that you don’t simply give up, or you don’t shy away from accepting that you didn’t achieve it. You instead take the opportunity to realise it’s instead something you just have to work on and that you simply aren’t there, YET! It’s going to come at some stage.</p>
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>I had watched the Carol Dweck video during the prep material and found the concept fascinating, but I just associated it with learning. Upon reading more material, I realised it hadn’t occurred to me that the concept of fixed vs. growth mindset can be adapted more broadly to encompass other areas. For example, that it can be used to explore your relationships, that it can be seen in how we display certain behaviours, such as a desire to project a false image of yourself when you feel you may not be on the same level as others on something. I found it very interesting and will be something I’ll have in the back of my mind going forward.</p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>I hope to integrate growth mindset in those instances where I hit a wall and perhaps start to feel behind or inadequate in some way. I just need to keep in mind the ‘not yet’ voice. As well I hope to use growth mindset to try and be more honest and open when having discussions with my facilitators and classmates. </p>

      <h3>Neuroplasticity, Growth Mindset, and my learning plan and strategy</h3>
      <p>I believe Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset have already influenced my learning plan since I came across these ideas in the prep material. It helped me in trying to make sure that how I organised myself in Foundations needs to be consistent, so keeping to a regular schedule, and as well making sure that I understand when I can best focus and when I should take breaks. I use the pomodoro technique to try and better focus, and make sure my brain is best able to make connections. I allow breaks during the day so if I ever get stuck I always have time to get my thoughts straight and try again afterwards. It’s also helped my general mindset of knowing that I can learn these concepts and that people who have already learnt this before me don’t have some magical gift, they just worked hard. And on top of this having the mindset that if others are ahead then it’s not a reflection of how I’m learning, it’s a reflection of their own work and how much time and effort they’ve put in. And also remembering that I’ll get to that point, but I have to keep working to get there (but I don’t need to be there now).</p>
