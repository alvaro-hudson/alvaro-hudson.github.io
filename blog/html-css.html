        <p>Inline and inline block to me are a little bit like buying a new bookshelf with adjustable shelves and then 
          trying to figure out and organise how to best fit your books and other items on there.
          <br><br>
          For this topic, we can start by breaking the concept down into 3 different ideas: block, inline, and inline-block.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Block</h2>
        <p>So imagine you have your new bookshelf up and you want to organise the few books that you have. You start 
          by putting one book at the left on the top shelf and then go, great that will do for this shelf! Block is 
          like putting one thing on a shelf and telling yourself that it needs the entire width of the shelf for itself. 
          If it’s a massive book, or this is how you like to organise your book(s), then it might work well. But you might 
          also be thinking there’s so much space to the right and I want to be able to start putting new books in there! 
          What other ways can I do this. </p>
        <h3>What does this look like in code?</h3>
        <p>So imagine you had 5 <p> elements. Each with ‘book’. They will just stack on top of each other like this. Each has 
            their own ‘block’ which takes up the whole width of the page, or the whole ‘shelf’.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Inline</h2>
        <p>So most people with lots of books would think, having one book on each shelf is not the most efficient way to do this. 
          I should probably put them beside each other on the same shelf. That’s what inline does. The books we put together on 
          the same shelf though are all of the same height as we are limited by the height of the shelf. We can’t obviously have 
          a book that’s twice as high as the shelf we have.</p>
        <h3>What does this look like in code?</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Inline-Block</h2>
        <p>Now, sometimes we don’t want to use a bookshelf just for books. We might also want to stack some boxes in there. Luckily 
          the bookshelf we bought has adjustable shelves! And that’s where inline-block comes in. So you look at the shelf and realise 
          the boxes you have can’t fit. Boom, lets just adjust the shelf so it’s bigger. Now we can stack these bigger boxes beside 
          each other on the same shelf.</p>
        <h3>So what does this look like in code?</h3>
        <p>So in CSS we can set the display to display: inline-block. So if you have elements that you’ve styled to have a specific 
          size you can now put them beside each other rather than just sitting on top of each other. </p>
