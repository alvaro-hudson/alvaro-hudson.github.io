    <h3>Long term goal/pathway</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t have a specific job in mind, my goal is more to reach a point where I have 
      options, flexibility, and balance between work/life. I know to get there I need 
      to start an entry level job and work my way up, but I want to be in a position where 
      I have the knowledge and skills to be able to take on a number of roles, be able to 
      go in a different direction with coding. As well to have the flexibility to work in 
      different parts of the world, to be financially secure and to have a job that doesn’t 
      overshadow the rest of my life, and in particular a job that doesn’t constantly drain 
      me emotionally.
    </p>

    <h3>Strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
    <p>
      I think my strengths are that I am motivated and interested in what we are learning 
      and I think I’m alright with picking things up at a good pace. My limitations when 
      studying in the past were probably my efficiency when studying, knowing how to best 
      organise and utilise my time, so that’s where I’m putting a fair bit of focus on now.
    </p>

    <h3>Human Skills I would like to develop</h3>
    <p>
      I would like to develop the ‘growth mindset’ a little more and emphasising this to both
      myself and others. I think confidence is something I would like to develop, not just in 
      the sense of believing I can complete a task, but also confidence in, for example, 
      presenting to a group, asking what I think might be a silly question, being confident in my ideas etc.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Commitment to managing the workload and working with others</h3>
    <p>
      I already have a daily working schedule that I am sticking to for the foundations.
      I will aim to then adapt this to the bootcamp, so have a daily schedule of how I will work ‘after-hours’.
    </p>
    <p> 
      In regards to working with others, I will be conscious of allowing space for others to participate,
      being aware of other people’s backgrounds and situations as well as ensuring I am self-aware. With
      working with a wide range of people I think adaptability is key to working productively with others,
      making sure I adapt my working style to best fit the other persons to be the most productive. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When things start to build up I would hope that I will have the common sense to reach out to my
      facilitator to come up with a short-term plan to release some of the pressure. Also talking to others
      in the cohort as they might have strategies to help, or just be a good support to help let off some steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regards to smaller help, for example I’m stuck on a task, I need to keep firmly in mind that I should
      ask for a hand if I can’t quite crack it after 15-20 minutes. The first stop will be in discord. In the
      bootcamp section I’m not yet sure of the exact set up so will need to come up with a strategy then.
    </p>
      
    <h3>Expectations of the facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect a certain degree of level-headedness to help bring me back to earth when I think 
      something may be too hard. I would expect timely replies to any queries I have and the option 
      to be able to talk one on one if a chat response, for example, doesn’t quite resolve my issue.
    </p>

    <h3>Scheduling conflicts</h3>
    <p>
      No scheduling conflicts at the current time
